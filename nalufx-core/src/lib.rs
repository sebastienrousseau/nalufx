//!
//! - API handlers for processing cash flow requests and generating predictions
//! - Configuration settings for customizing the behaviour of the library
//! - Error handling and custom error types
//! - Data models for representing cash flow requests and responses
//! - Service layer with business logic for fetching data and performing calculations
//! - Utility functions and helpers for common tasks
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! To use the Nalufx library in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:
//!
//! ```toml
